## React calculator

Using the React framework, build a functioning calculator with a nice UI using only HTML, CSS or a style preprocessor and JavaScript (or typescript). It does not need to handle all types of errors, but there should be some basic error reporting.

Requirements:
1. Should be able to perform an operation on two numbers.
2. Basic error reporting.
3. Code is modular and bug-free.
